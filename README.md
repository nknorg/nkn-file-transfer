# NKN File Transfer

A decentralized file transfer application using NKN client.

This application uses simple control mechanism similar to TCP. If you want to
use it in production, it's recommended to implement more advanced mechanism
(such as erasure coding) to achieve higher performance and reliability.

## Get Started

You need Go 1.12+ to build from source:

```shell
go get -u github.com/nknorg/nkn-file-transfer
```

Then you can use

```shell
go run github.com/nknorg/nkn-file-transfer -$MODE
```

to run it, where `$MODE` can be one of `send`, `receive`, `get`, `host`. `send`
mode should be used with `receive` mode to send file to peer, while `get` mode
should be used with `host` mode to fetch file to peer.

When starting as `receive` mode or `host`, you will see something like `Start
receiver in receive mode at xxx` or `Start sender in host mode at xxx`, where
`xxx` will be your NKN address, and you will need that address when sending or
getting files from other peers.

You can enable multiple modes together. For example, you can enable `receive`
mode together with `host` mode to create a file storage server that can accept
both send request (equivalent to HTTP PUT) and get request (equivalent to HTTP
GET), and you can use `send` mode with `get` mode to create a client that can
upload to (`send`) and download from (`get`) the aforementioned server. Actually
if you enable both `send` mode and `get` mode together, you can use
```
GET hostAddress/fileName
```
to download file, and
```
PUT receiveAddress/fileName localFilePath
```
to upload file.

By default a random NKN address (key pair) will be generated each time. You can
use a specific address by passing `-seed` and `-identifier` argument, same as a
NKN client. Use `-help` argument to see all supported arguments.
